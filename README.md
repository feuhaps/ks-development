Our intent is that further development take place using this repository with the impex files associated with builds being placed into the [ks-development-impex](https://github.com/kuali-student/ks-development-impex) repository.

To start with it is just the development branches for the fused enrollment_aggregate_trunk and the fused enrollment_aggregate_branches_CM-2.0
