<h2>Kuali Student on Github</h2>

Please refer to the Github based documentation here for the current status of the Git Repositories: http://kuali-student.github.io/

Our intent is that further development take place using this repository with the impex files associated with builds being placed into the [ks-development-impex](https://github.com/kuali-student/ks-development-impex) repository.

To start with it is just the development branches for the fused enrollment_aggregate_trunk and the fused enrollment_aggregate_branches_CM-2.0

This is the fusion of the enrollment_aggregate_branches_services with the enrollment_ks-api_trunk branch and represents the service contract work being prepared for future development cycles.
